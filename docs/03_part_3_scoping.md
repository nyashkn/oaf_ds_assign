# Scale-Up Planning Email - Part 3 Approach

## Purpose

This document outlines the approach for creating a 1-2 page email to an analyst that provides clear instructions for planning a 2-year countrywide scale-up of our successful loan repayment prediction model. The email must provide comprehensive guidance while allowing the analyst sufficient autonomy to develop the detailed implementation plan.

## Context

After successful implementation of our recommendation(s) in a 6-month regional trial, we now need to:
1. Scale the model countrywide over 2 years
2. Increase the number of low-risk farmers served
3. Maintain a 98% repayment rate

The analyst has access to:
- One manager
- A data analyst
- Several survey enumerators
- A government relations liaison

## Email Structure

### 1. Introduction & Context (2-3 paragraphs)
- Congratulate the analyst on their assignment to this strategic project
- Provide background on the successful regional trial
- Explain the business importance of the nationwide scale-up
- Outline the key objectives (expansion with 98% repayment rate)

### 2. Project Scope (3-4 bullet points)
- Clear statement of what is in scope (e.g., expansion to all regions, farmer targeting)
- Clear statement of what is out of scope (e.g., product modifications, pricing changes)
- Timeline expectations (4-6 months preparation, 2-year implementation)
- Success criteria (specific, measurable targets)

### 3. Key Considerations & Challenges (4-5 points)
- Regional variations to account for
- Operational scaling challenges
- Data collection and monitoring requirements
- Field team capacity considerations
- Regulatory or compliance factors

### 4. Team Resources & Roles (1 paragraph + bullets)
- How to effectively utilize the available team members
- Specific responsibilities to assign to each role
- Additional resources that may need to be requested

### 5. Phased Approach Recommendation (3-4 phases)
- Suggested phasing for the 2-year rollout
- Key milestones for each phase
- Logical sequence of regions/activities
- Evaluation points for course correction

### 6. Final Deliverable Specifications (detailed outline)
- Format and structure of the expansion plan
- Required sections and components
- Level of detail expected
- Supporting materials to include (e.g., timelines, resource plans)

### 7. Timeline & Next Steps (1 paragraph + dates)
- When the initial draft is expected
- Review process and feedback cycles
- Final delivery date
- Implementation kickoff timing

## Key Elements to Include in Deliverable Specifications

The email will specify that the analyst's expansion plan should include:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Key objectives and strategy
- Resource requirements
- Expected outcomes
- Critical success factors

### 2. Regional Analysis & Prioritization
- Data-driven approach to regional sequencing
- Regional risk profiles and opportunity sizing
- Adaptation requirements for different regions
- Prioritization methodology with clear criteria

### 3. Operational Scaling Plan
- Team expansion requirements
- Training and knowledge transfer approach
- Process standardization needs
- Technology infrastructure scaling

### 4. Data Strategy
- Collection methodology for new regions
- Model retraining schedule
- Performance monitoring framework
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

### 5. Risk Management Framework
- Identified scaling risks
- Mitigation strategies
- Contingency plans
- Early warning indicators

### 6. Success Metrics & Reporting
- KPI definitions and targets
- Reporting cadence and audiences
- Regional vs. national benchmarks
- Course correction triggers

### 7. Timeline & Implementation Roadmap
- Detailed Gantt chart for 2-year rollout
- Resource allocation over time
- Critical dependencies
- Decision points and phase gates

### 8. Budget & Resource Requirements
- Financial projections
- Staffing plans
- Technology investments
- Training and change management costs

- Scope: [Clear definition of what should be included/excluded]

AVAILABLE RESOURCES
You'll be working with the following team:
- Project Manager: [Name] - Oversees project timeline and coordination
- Data Analyst: [Name] - Supports with data analysis and model adaptation
- Survey Enumerators: Team of [X] - Available for field data collection
- Government Relations Liaison: [Name] - Assists with regulatory considerations

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
[List of critical factors to address in the plan]

DELIVERABLE SPECIFICATIONS
Please develop a comprehensive scale-up plan covering:

1. Regional Analysis & Prioritization
   [Details on expected content]

2. Operational Scaling Framework
   [Details on expected content]

[Continue with other sections...]

The final deliverable should be a comprehensive document with supporting materials (e.g., timelines, budget projections, resource allocation plans). I've attached a template with the recommended structure.

TIMELINE
- Initial outline: [Date]
- First draft: [Date]
- Review meeting: [Date]
- Final deliverable: [Date]

Please schedule a kick-off meeting for next week so we can discuss any questions you might have.

I'm confident your analytical skills and attention to detail make you ideal for this strategic initiative. This project will significantly impact our ability to serve more farmers while maintaining our financial sustainability.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
