# AI Integration Plan for Loan Repayment Prediction (Part 1.2)

## Context

One Acre Fund is exploring the potential use of text-based field agent reports and voice transcriptions from farmer interactions to enhance their loan repayment prediction model. This document outlines how AI technologies could be leveraged to extract meaningful features from these unstructured data sources to improve repayment predictions.

## Value Proposition

Incorporating text and voice data can provide critical contextual information that numerical data alone cannot capture:

1. **Early Warning Signals**: Farmers may verbally express challenges before they manifest in payment behavior
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Insights into local conditions affecting repayment (weather events, market changes)
3. **Behavioral Indicators**: Sentiment and commitment levels that may predict follow-through
4. **Social Factors**: Community dynamics and support systems that influence repayment

## Data Sources & Collection Strategy

### Field Agent Reports
- **Content**: Structured and unstructured notes from field visits
- **Collection**: Mobile app or form submissions after farmer interactions
- **Frequency**: Regular check-ins (weekly/monthly) plus ad-hoc reports
- **Key Elements**: 
  - Observed farm conditions
  - Farmer statements about challenges
  - Agent assessment of risk factors
  - Actions taken during visit

### Voice Transcriptions
- **Content**: Recordings of farmer interactions with agents or call center
- **Collection**: Recorded calls or in-field conversations with consent
- **Processing**: Speech-to-text conversion with speaker identification
- **Security**: Local language processing with appropriate privacy controls

## Text Processing Techniques

### 1. Preprocessing
- **Language Detection & Translation**: Handle multiple local languages and dialects
- **Tokenization**: Break text into analyzable units
- **Normalization**: Account for spelling variations, especially for local terms
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminate common words, customized for agricultural context

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
  - Identify mentions of crops, inputs, weather events
  - Extract monetary references, dates, and locations
  - Detect mentions of family events (illness, celebrations)

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Overall sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Emotion detection (concern, confidence, uncertainty)
  - Commitment level indicators

- **Topic Modeling**:
  - Identify common discussion themes
  - Track topic frequency over time
  - Detect emerging concerns across regions

- **Temporal Pattern Analysis**:
  - Changes in language over time
  - Shifting topics between visits
  - Evolution of sentiment

### 3. Agricultural-Specific NLP Enhancements
- **Custom Entity Recognition**: Train models to recognize:
  - Local crop varieties and farming techniques
  - Region-specific challenges
  - Cultural events affecting finances

- **Agricultural Knowledge Graph**:
  - Connect entities (crops, weather, market prices)
  - Map seasonal dependencies
  - Link regional factors to payment behavior

## Voice Processing Considerations

### 1. Speech-to-Text Pipeline
- **Acoustic Models**: Adapt to local accents and dialects
- **Language Models**: Train on agricultural vocabulary
- **Speaker Diarization**: Distinguish between agent and farmer

### 2. Paralinguistic Feature Extraction
- **Tone Analysis**: Detect stress, confidence, hesitation
- **Speech Rate**: Changes indicating uncertainty or evasion
- **Voice Quality**: Indicators of emotional state

### 3. Multi-Modal Integration
- Combine transcribed content with acoustic features
- Account for cultural differences in expression
- Validate against agent observations

## AI Model Development

### 1. Feature Creation
- **Text-Based Features**:
  - Sentiment scores by topic
  - Entity presence/absence flags
  - Topic distribution vectors
  - Temporal change indicators

- **Voice-Based Features**:
  - Acoustic confidence scores
  - Emotional state indicators
  - Conversation flow metrics

### 2. Integration Methods
- **Feature-Level Fusion**:
  - Add extracted features to existing model
  - Weight features based on predictive power
  - Apply feature selection to prevent overfitting

- **Model-Level Fusion**:
  - Develop separate models for structured and unstructured data
  - Create ensemble combining multiple predictions
  - Use stacked generalization approaches

- **End-to-End Learning**:
  - Deep learning models incorporating text embeddings
  - Multi-modal neural networks for combined processing
  - Transfer learning from pre-trained language models

### 3. Model Selection
- **Interpretable Models** for feature validation:
  - Logistic regression with text features
  - Decision trees incorporating key text indicators
  - Rule-based systems for high-confidence patterns

- **Advanced Models** for maximum performance:
  - BERT/RoBERTa fine-tuned for agricultural domain
  - XGBoost with text-derived features
  - Deep learning for multi-modal inputs
