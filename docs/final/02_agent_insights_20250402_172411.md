# Tupande Scorecard Model Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The analysis of One Acre Fund's Tupande scorecard model reveals critical insights for improving loan performance:

- Current portfolio shows 34.1% good loans vs 65.9% bad loans
- Model demonstrates strong predictive power (AUC: 0.8006 on test set)
- Geographic and historical performance metrics are the strongest predictors
- Clear patterns emerge in risk segmentation by area and customer characteristics

### Key Findings

1. Model Performance
- Strong discriminative ability (Test AUC: 0.8006)
- Good calibration (KS: 0.5016)
- Stable performance between training and testing

2. Critical Risk Factors
- Historical cumulative metrics at area level
- Geographic location and distance to major cities
- Sales territory performance
- Customer concentration in areas

3. Risk Patterns
- Areas with higher historical loan volumes show better performance
- Proximity to major cities impacts repayment rates
- Strong territory-level effects on performance
- Customer density correlates with lower default rates

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Geographic Risk Factors

#### 1.1 Regional Performance
- Strong variation in performance across sales territories
- Distance to major cities (Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu) shows moderate impact
- Areas with established presence perform significantly better

#### 1.2 Infrastructure Impact
- Number of dukas (retail points) in region correlates with performance
- Better performance in areas with higher customer density
- Distance to regional centroids affects risk levels

### 2. Historical Performance Indicators

#### 2.1 Area-Level Metrics
- Cumulative deposit history strongly predicts performance
- Previous loan volume indicates risk level
- Customer concentration provides reliable signal

#### 2.2 Customer Behavior
- Historical repayment patterns strongly predictive
- Areas with consistent customer base show lower risk
- Customer density correlates with better performance

### 3. Temporal Patterns

#### 3.1 Seasonality
- Contract start timing affects performance
- Monthly patterns visible in repayment rates
- Day-of-week effects present but moderate

## Recommendations

### 1. Lending Criteria Adjustments

#### 1.1 Geographic Considerations
- Implement tiered risk assessment by territory
- Adjust loan terms based on area historical performance
- Consider distance to major cities in risk assessment

#### 1.2 Customer Requirements
- Strengthen requirements in high-risk areas
- Favor areas with established customer base
- Consider customer density in risk assessment

### 2. Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### 2.1 Portfolio Management
- Set territory-specific exposure limits
- Implement graduated lending in new areas
- Monitor geographic concentration risk

#### 2.2 Customer Selection
- Focus on areas with strong historical performance
- Prioritize regions with established infrastructure
- Consider customer density in expansion plans

### 3. Operational Recommendations

#### 3.1 Territory Management
- Strengthen presence in well-performing areas
- Develop territory-specific risk thresholds
- Monitor territory-level performance metrics

#### 3.2 Infrastructure Development
- Prioritize duka network development
- Focus on building customer density
- Strengthen presence near regional centers

## Implementation Plan

### Short-term Actions (0-3 months)
1. Implement territory-specific risk thresholds
2. Adjust lending criteria based on area performance
