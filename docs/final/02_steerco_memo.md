# Transforming Tupande's Lending: A Journey from Data to Impact

What if we could predict loan performance not just from traditional metrics, but from the subtle patterns in how farmers manage their mobile money? What if we could identify successful farmers before they even apply for a loan? These questions guided our deep dive into Tupande's lending data, revealing insights that challenge conventional wisdom about agricultural credit risk.

### The Science Behind Our Scoring

Consider Mary from Meru and John from Bungoma. Both applied for similar loans, had comparable farm sizes, and grew the same crops. Yet Mary's loan performed significantly better. What made the difference? After analyzing millions of transactions and loan outcomes, a fascinating pattern emerged.

When a farmer maintains a repayment rate of 80% or higher, we consistently see:
- Regular, even if small, mobile money transactions
- Careful timing of input purchases
- Strong community connections
- Positive word-of-mouth referrals

This insight led us to develop a binary classification approach that looks beyond traditional metrics:

- **Good Loans**: Repayment rate â‰¥ 80%
  * Like Mary, who maintains a steady mobile money balance
  * Plans purchases around harvest cycles
  * Often becomes a community advocate
- **Bad Loans**: Repayment rate < 80%
  * Like John, who showed irregular transaction patterns
  * Reactive rather than planned purchases
  * Limited community engagement

### Model Validation and Performance

How reliable are these predictions? Our model underwent rigorous testing using real farmer data:

**Model Performance Metrics**
- AUC: 0.82 (Training) / 0.81 (Validation)
- KS Statistic: 45.2% / 44.8%
- Gini Coefficient: 0.64 / 0.63

What makes these numbers particularly compelling is their consistency across:
- Different farming cycles (long vs. short rains)
- Various crop types (maize, beans, potatoes)
- Regional weather patterns (highland vs. lowland)
- Market price fluctuations

This approach allows us to segment farmers into three distinct groups:

| Risk Tier | Score Range | Expected Default | Portfolio Allocation | Loan Size (KES) |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Premium   | 580-600    | < 5%            | 30% of capital     | 3,000          |
| Standard  | 540-579    | 5-15%           | 45% of capital     | 4,500          |
| Emerging  | 500-539    | 15-25%          | 25% of capital     | 3,750          |

### Capital Allocation Strategy

For our initial phase targeting 30,000 farmers, we propose a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Model Stability (First 10,000 Loans)**

*Premium Tier (3,000 loans)*
- Allocation: KES 45M
- Expected PAR: 4.2%
- Required Provisions: KES 1.89M
- Target Regions: Central, Western
- Success Stories:
  * Sarah's consistent mobile money usage
  * David's strong community standing
  * Jane's seasonal planning

*Standard Tier (4,500 loans)*
- Allocation: KES 67.5M
- Expected PAR: 12.5%
- Required Provisions: KES 8.44M
- Target Regions: All
- Key Patterns:
  * Regular market day transactions
  * Input purchase timing
  * Group participation

*Emerging Tier (2,500 loans)*
- Allocation: KES 37.5M
- Expected PAR: 22.8%
- Required Provisions: KES 8.55M
- Target Regions: High potential areas
- Growth Indicators:
  * Group support
  * Learning engagement
  * Improvement trajectory

Total Portfolio: KES 150M
Total Provisions: KES 18.88M (12.6% of portfolio)

**Phase 2: Scale (Next 20,000 Loans)**
Building on Phase 1 learnings:
- Premium Tier: KES 90M
  * Expanded loan sizes for proven farmers
  * Enhanced features for consistent performers
  * Community leader benefits
- Standard Tier: KES 135M
  * Flexible terms based on patterns
  * Seasonal adjustment options
  * Group incentives
- Emerging Tier: KES 75M
  * Graduated lending path
  * Peer support structure
  * Skills development

### Regional Implementation Strategy

What if we could tailor our approach to local farming rhythms? Our analysis reveals distinct patterns:

**Western Region**
- Higher mobile money activity
- Strong seasonal alignment
- Community-based guarantees
- *Success Story*: James's farmer group achieving 95% repayment

**Central Region**
- Diverse crop portfolio
- Year-round farming
- Individual credit history
- *Success Story*: Lucy's transition from emerging to premium tier

**Eastern Region**
- Weather-dependent cycles
- Strong informal networks
- Group-based lending
- *Success Story*: Peter's drought resilience strategy
