# Tupande Scorecard Model Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Tupande scorecard modeling data and supporting documentation, we have identified key patterns and opportunities for improving loan performance. The analysis reveals that loan repayment behavior is influenced by multiple factors across six main categories: Basic Metrics, Performance, Geographic, Historical, Relative Position, and Infrastructure.

### Key Findings:

1. **Payment Behavior Indicators**
   - Deposit ratio (initial deposit / contract value) is a critical early indicator of loan performance
   - Historical cumulative payments provide strong signals for risk assessment
   - Temporal patterns in payment behavior affect repayment likelihood

2. **Geographic Factors**
   - Regional variations significantly impact repayment rates
   - Distance to major cities (Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu) influences performance
   - Local infrastructure density (distinct_dukas) correlates with repayment rates

3. **Historical Performance**
   - Area-level historical performance strongly predicts future repayment
   - Cumulative customer base in an area indicates market maturity
   - Historical deposit patterns signal market stability

## 2. Detailed Insights by Business Impact

### 2.1. Risk Assessment Framework

1. **Primary Risk Indicators**
   - Deposit Ratio: Strong predictor of loan performance
   - Historical Area Performance: Provides context for risk assessment
   - Geographic Location: Impacts repayment probability
   - Infrastructure Access: Correlates with repayment capacity

2. **Secondary Risk Factors**
   - Temporal Patterns: Contract timing affects performance
   - Market Maturity: Areas with established customer base show different risk profiles
   - Distance to Urban Centers: Impacts market access and repayment capacity

### 2.2. Geographic Risk Patterns

1. **Regional Variations**
   - Distance to major cities impacts repayment rates
   - Infrastructure density correlates with performance
   - Historical market penetration indicates risk levels

2. **Local Market Dynamics**
   - Number of distinct retail points (dukas) indicates market strength
   - Customer concentration affects group loan performance
   - Historical loan volume signals market maturity

## 3. Strategic Recommendations

### 3.1. Lending Criteria Adjustments

1. **Deposit Requirements**
   - Implement tiered deposit requirements based on:
     * Historical area performance

     * Local infrastructure density
   - Adjust deposit thresholds based on seasonal patterns

2. **Geographic Considerations**
   - Develop region-specific lending criteria
   - Consider infrastructure density in loan terms
   - Adjust risk assessment based on distance to urban centers

3. **Historical Performance Integration**
   - Weight area-level historical performance in approval process
   - Consider market maturity in risk assessment
   - Evaluate customer concentration impact

### 3.2. Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Market Development Focus**
   - Prioritize infrastructure development in high-potential areas
   - Build retail networks in underserved regions
   - Strengthen group formation in areas with low customer density

2. **Monitoring Framework**
   - Track early warning indicators:
     * Changes in deposit ratios
     * Payment pattern deviations
     * Geographic performance shifts

3. **Intervention Triggers**
   - Define intervention thresholds based on:
     * Historical performance benchmarks
     * Regional risk profiles
     * Market maturity indicators

## 4. Visualization Recommendations
