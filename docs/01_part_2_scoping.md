# Steering Committee Memo - Part 2 Approach

## Purpose

This document outlines the approach for creating a 1-2 page memo to the Tupande Steering Committee that communicates the findings from our repayment prediction model and provides clear recommendations for improving lending strategy.

## Target Audience

The Steering Committee consists of non-technical stakeholders from across the organization who are responsible for strategic decisions. The memo must be clear, concise, and focused on business impacts rather than technical details.

## Key Objectives

The memo needs to address the Tupande objectives:
- Achieve a repayment rate of 98%
- Reduce the default rate to 1%
- Expand the farmers served by accurately targeting those most likely to repay their loan on time

## Memo Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
- Brief context of the task
- Key finding in one sentence
- Main recommendation in one sentence
- Expected impact in one sentence

### 2. Context & Problem Statement (2-3 paragraphs)
- Current lending situation and challenges
- Business objectives being addressed
- Approach taken at a high level (avoiding technical jargon)
- Scope of the analysis

### 3. Key Findings (3-5 bullet points with brief explanations)
- Most significant factors affecting loan repayment
- Identified patterns in defaults
- Regional/demographic insights
- Unexpected or counter-intuitive discoveries
- Quantified impact potential

### 4. Strategic Recommendations (2-3 recommendations)
Each recommendation will include:
- Clear action statement
- Expected impact
- Implementation requirements
- Potential challenges and mitigations
- Metrics for success

### 5. Implementation Roadmap
- Short-term actions (next 3 months)
- Medium-term initiatives (3-12 months)
- How this connects to broader organizational goals

### 6. Next Steps
- Immediate actions required from the Steering Committee
- Dependencies and critical resources needed
- Timeline for decision and implementation

## Visual Elements

The memo will include 2-3 visualizations that effectively communicate key insights:

1. **Repayment Risk Segmentation Chart**
   - Visual representation of customer segments by risk level
   - Clear indication of which segments to target/avoid

2. **Impact Projection Graph**
   - Before/after comparison showing expected improvements
   - Clear connection to the 98% repayment target

3. **Implementation Timeline**
   - Simple visualization of key milestones
   - Dependencies and decision points clearly marked

## Language Guidelines

To ensure clarity for non-technical stakeholders:

- Minimize jargon and technical terms
- Define any necessary technical concepts in simple language
- Focus on business outcomes rather than model details
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Employ active voice and direct language
- Present data in context with clear implications

## Review Process

Before submission, the memo will be reviewed for:

1. **Clarity**: Can someone without technical background understand all key points?
2. **Actionability**: Are recommendations specific and implementable?
3. **Alignment**: Do recommendations directly support stated objectives?
4. **Evidence**: Are claims supported by data and analysis?
5. **Conciseness**: Is the document focused and within the 1-2 page limit?
